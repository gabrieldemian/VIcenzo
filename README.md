## Introduction
Vincenzo aims to be a fast, lightweight, and multi-platform client.

Another goal is for users to be able to use the [library](crates/vincenzo) to create any other kind of software, that is powered by the BitTorrent protocol.

The official UI binary is very niched, targeting a very specific type of user: someone who loves using the terminal, and vim keybindings. Altough users could create other UIs using the library.

Vincenzo offers 3 binaries and 1 library:

- [vcz](crates/vcz) - Main binary with both UI and daemon.
- [vcz_ui](crates/vcz_ui) - UI binary.
- [vczd](crates/vcz_daemon) - Daemon binary.
- [vincenzo](crates/vincenzo) - Library

## Features
- Multi-platform.
- Multithreaded. One OS thread specific for I/O.
- Async I/O with tokio.
- Communication with daemon using CLI flags, TCP messages or remotely via UI binary.
- Detached daemon from the UI.
- Support for magnet links.

## How to use
Downloading a torrent using the main binary (the flags are optional and could be omitted in favour of the configuration file).

```bash
vcz -d "/tmp/download_dir" -m "<magnet link here>" -q
```

## Configuration
The binaries read a toml config file.
It is located at the default config folder of your OS.
- Linux:   ~/.config/vincenzo/config.toml
- Windows: C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\Vincenzo\config.toml
- MacOS:   /Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/Vincenzo/config.toml
  
### Default config file:
```toml
download_dir = "/home/alice/Downloads"
# default
daemon_addr = "127.0.0.1:3030"
```

## Daemon and UI binaries
Users can control the Daemon by using CLI flags that work as messages.

Let's say on one terminal you initiate the daemon: `vczd`. Or spawn as a background process so you can do everything on one terminal: `vczd &`.

And you open a second terminal to send messages to the daemon, add a torrent: `vczd -m "magnet:..."` and then print the stats to stdout `vczd --stats`.

You can also run the UI binary (maybe remotely from another machine) to control the Daemon: `vcz_ui --daemon-addr 127.0.0.1:3030`.

Usage: vczd [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --daemon-addr <DAEMON_ADDR>    The Daemon will accept TCP connections on this address
  -d, --download-dir <DOWNLOAD_DIR>  The directory in which torrents will be downloaded
  -m, --magnet <MAGNET>              Download a torrent using it's magnet link, wrapped in quotes
  -q, --quit-after-complete          If the program should quit after all torrents are fully downloaded
  -s, --stats                        Print all torrent status on stdout
  -h, --help                         Print help
