- Magnet links support <br />
- Terminal based with vim keybindings <br />
- UDP connections with trackers, TCP connections with peers <br />
- Multithreaded. One OS thread specific for I/O. <br />

## How to use
An example on how to download a torrent using the CLI. Please use the "--help" flag to read the descriptions of the CLI flags.

⏳ - Resume torrent download. <br />
⏳ - Change piece download strategy. <br />
⏳ - Select files to download. <br />
