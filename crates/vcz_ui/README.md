# Overview

This is the official UI of Vincenzo, this is not published to crates.io.

If you are using the UI, you must have the daemon running beforehand,
otherwise it will error.

If you want to run both the UI and the daemon at the same time,
to go the main crate `vcz`.

To use this binary, you need to know the address in which the daemon is running,
you can pass that on the config file or through CLI flags.
